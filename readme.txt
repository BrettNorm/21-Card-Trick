The big idea of HW2 is to use a pseudo-random number generator to shuffle an abbreviated deck of cards with 21 cards. 
At the start of an execution, your program should display on the screen the shuffled cards (face up, as it were), and 
ask the interactive user to pick one of the cards and either memorize it, or write it down. But the user should NOT 
tell the computer what that card is. The computer is going to "read the user's mind" and tell the user the card. 
(The program does NOT read the user's mind in any creepy way. This is a trick that relies on manipulating where in the deck a card appears.)

How to do the trick is shown in the video. The narrator really does the trick in two parts: first, figuring out which 
card it is (by locating it as the 11th card in the deck of 21 cards); and second, having the user pick out piles which 
she cleverly either eliminates or keeps in order to reveal the card.
