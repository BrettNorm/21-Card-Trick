- At the start of an execution, program dispalys shuffled cards on screen (face up, as it were), and 
asks the interactive user to pick one of the cards and either memorize it, or write it down. 
- The computer is going to "read the user's mind" and tell the user the card. 
    - (The program does NOT read the user's mind in any creepy way. This is a trick that relies on manipulating where in the deck a card appears.)

How to do the trick shown in video 
The narrator really does the trick in two parts: 
  - First, figuring out which card it is (by locating it as the 11th card in the deck of 21 cards); 
  - Second, having the user pick out piles which she cleverly either eliminates or keeps in order to reveal the card.
